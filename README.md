# Secure Reverse Shell (SRS) Pack

**NOTE** - Due to Replit's new update, where the only way to host a project is deployments, the server is broken, and this might require a change in URL when I will have to update both, the Server module, Client module and even the Host module. So if your host version is less than v2.8.15 then it is safe and running but wont be able to connect from Client. The only way to connect to the Host v2.8.15 is to manipulate Client's memory and change the URL to the old server (<https://srs-host.adaptable.app>) but it is not recommended and the old server is slow and has a lot of rate limitations. Unfortunately, I, at the moment, can't do anything about it.

## What is SRS Pack?
SRS stands for Secure Reverse Shell which starts an "always open" vulnerability on a target (Host) which can then be connected to via an attacker (Client). A connection middleware (Server) is online where one can use the Client Module to connect to any system having the Host Module up and running. Find active hosts on the Server Module.
